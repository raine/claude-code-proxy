# Changelog

## v0.0.8 (2026-04-30)

- Added exponential backoff retry on upstream 429 errors, respecting
  `Retry-After` headers when present
- Added `config.json` as an alternative to environment variables (read from
  `~/.config/claude-code-proxy/config.json` on macOS, XDG-compliant on Linux)
- Made the `originator` and `User-Agent` headers configurable via new env vars
  (`CCP_CODEX_ORIGINATOR`, `CCP_CODEX_USER_AGENT`, `CCP_KIMI_USER_AGENT`,
  `CCP_ORIGINATOR`, `CCP_USER_AGENT`) and the config file
- Codex now sends a default `User-Agent: claude-code-proxy/<version>` header
- Stopped including the `v` prefix in build version strings

## v0.0.7 (2026-04-25)

- Some security hardening inspired by [#5](https://github.com/raine/claude-code-proxy/pull/5)

## v0.0.6 (2026-04-25)

- Added support for `gpt-5.5`, and `opus`/`claude-opus-4-7` aliases now map to
  `gpt-5.5` instead of `gpt-5.4`
- Model names with a `[1m]` context suffix (e.g. `gpt-5.4[1m]`) are now
  accepted and stripped before routing, so Claude Code's larger-context model
  variants work without errors
- Documented how to switch between the proxy and direct Anthropic in the README

## v0.0.5 (2026-04-22)

- Added `CCP_CODEX_MODEL` and `CCP_CODEX_EFFORT` environment variables to
  override the model and reasoning effort for Codex requests
  ([#2](https://github.com/raine/claude-code-proxy/pull/2))
- Added `claude-sonnet-4-6` and additional model aliases so more Claude-style
  model names resolve correctly
- Improved request logging with usage summaries, time-to-first-byte metrics, and
  stream completion details for easier debugging
- Client disconnections during streaming are now handled gracefully

## v0.0.4 (2026-04-20)

- Kimi: reasoning content is now preserved across turns as Anthropic thinking
  blocks, so Claude Code sees the model's thinking and multi-turn reasoning
  stays coherent
- Kimi: thinking is always enabled

## v0.0.3 (2026-04-20)

- Renamed to `claude-code-proxy` to reflect multi-provider support
- Added Kimi (kimi.com) as a provider, with device-code login via the install
  script and support for Kimi's chat models
- Requests are now routed to providers based on the requested model, so a single
  proxy can serve both Codex and Kimi models simultaneously
- Improved token counting accuracy and fixed cached token usage reporting
- Added MIT license

## v0.0.2 (2026-04-19)

- Accept Claude-style model aliases (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, and `claude-*`
  names), resolving them to the appropriate upstream model so portable configs
  and subagents work without edits
- Fix malformed streamed Read tool arguments that Claude Code would reject when
  upstream emitted an empty `pages` field

## v0.0.1 (2026-04-19)

Initial release.
