# Changelog

## v0.0.5 (2026-04-22)

- Added `CCP_CODEX_MODEL` and `CCP_CODEX_EFFORT` environment variables to
  override the model and reasoning effort for Codex requests
  ([#2](https://github.com/raine/claude-code-proxy/pull/2))
- Added `claude-sonnet-4-6` and additional model aliases so more Claude-style
  model names resolve correctly
- Improved request logging with usage summaries, time-to-first-byte metrics, and
  stream completion details for easier debugging
- Client disconnections during streaming are now handled gracefully

## v0.0.4 (2026-04-20)

- Kimi: reasoning content is now preserved across turns as Anthropic thinking
  blocks, so Claude Code sees the model's thinking and multi-turn reasoning
  stays coherent
- Kimi: thinking is always enabled

## v0.0.3 (2026-04-20)

- Renamed to `claude-code-proxy` to reflect multi-provider support
- Added Kimi (kimi.com) as a provider, with device-code login via the install
  script and support for Kimi's chat models
- Requests are now routed to providers based on the requested model, so a single
  proxy can serve both Codex and Kimi models simultaneously
- Improved token counting accuracy and fixed cached token usage reporting
- Added MIT license

## v0.0.2 (2026-04-19)

- Accept Claude-style model aliases (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, and `claude-*`
  names), resolving them to the appropriate upstream model so portable configs
  and subagents work without edits
- Fix malformed streamed Read tool arguments that Claude Code would reject when
  upstream emitted an empty `pages` field

## v0.0.1 (2026-04-19)

Initial release.
